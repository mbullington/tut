# telefrag

Telefrag is simple state management for Dart apps (telefrag package), as
well as Flutter apps (telefrag_flutter package).

Telefrag is base on [Models](https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui#armadillo-models-) from
the Fuchsia team.

Telefrag is still in alpha, so it's not published on pub just yet (will
be really soon).

## Usage

A simple (but unpractical) example of using reducers, generators, and stores in
Telefrag is located in `telefrag/example/telefrag_example.dart`.

`telefrag_flutter/example/flutter_example.dart` also shows an example of a
StatefulWidget in Flutter taking advantage of a store in Telefrag.
